time speed-factor slider (& reset button)
	rough idea on impl:
		clockTime = (currentTime - timeWhenSpeedChanged) * speedFactor
digital clock
ascii clock (promotable to a command line program, the original idea)
	params:
		size {small, medium, large}
		timezone { ... }
		help
clock impl menu

further decomposition of program structure. Clocks can render multiple ways...


further abstraction of "clock" idea.
	basically a cyclical function whose parameter is time.
	key is: the state of the display should repeat 1, 2, or more times a day.
